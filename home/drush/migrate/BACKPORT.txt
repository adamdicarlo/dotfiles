Differences visible to users/implementors:

Migration names (BeerUser etc.) must be typed case-sensitively in drush commands
in D6 - D7 is case-insensitive.

Field handlers have no $field_info parameter in D6

D6 has no machine names for vocabularies - the D6 migrate module will basically
generate one from the the user-visible name (lower-case, spaces=>underscores),
there is a small risk of collision as a result if vocabulary names differ only
in punctuation and/or case.

migrate_ui does not support vertical tabs on migration detail pages on D6.


Conventions to make porting changes between Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 easier:

Try to always use specific DBTNG functions such as db_select() instead of the more
general db_query(), which needs to be renamed to dbtng_query() under Drupal 6.


TODOs for initial backport to Drupal 6:

Most of the visible differences above can probably be eliminated
MigrateDestinationTerm constructor takes name instead of machine name as a
 parameter, should use a generated machine name.
node.inc: Retrieve attached fields in fields()
comment.inc: Changes needed for D6 comment_save() (form assumptions)
fields.inc: File API changes
image field support
