<p>These options affect migration processes:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Display timers when processing</dt>
    <dd>When developing large, complex migration processes (where you are implementing
        your own hooks), it's important to optimize processing as best you can. To help
        diagnose performance problems, enable this checkbox to display cumulative
        timers upon completion of an interactive migration. The migrate module's own
        hooks use Drupal's timer_start() and timer_stop() functions to track their timing -
        you can also add these calls to your own hooks.</dd>
  <dt>Cache content set counts</dt>
    <dd>With large amounts of data, particularly when your source views join
        multiple tables, loading the Dashboard page can become quite slow populating
        the <strong>Rows in set</strong> column. Checking this box saves the current
        row count in the database, and the dashboard will retrieve this value rather than
        recounting the rows every time. To update the counts, return to the settings page,
        check the <strong>Refresh cached content set counts</strong> toggle, and Submit.</dd>
  <dt>Ignore missing advanced help module</dt>
    <dd>Checking this toggle disables messages displayed when the advanced help module
        is not active. If you're reading this advanced help page, this toggle is
        irrelevant to you.</dd>
</dl>
