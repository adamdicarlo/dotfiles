<p>To get the most out of the migrate module, one should understand the following concepts:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Content set</dt>
    <dd>This represents a set of source content (embodied in a view) to be migrated.
        It includes mappings from columns in the view
        to fields within Drupal objects.</dd>
  <dt>Destination</dt>
    <dd>A Drupal object designated to receive migrated data from a source view.
        Most destinations are simple - roles, terms, users - but nodes are more
        complex - each distinct node type defined in your Drupal site is a
        distinct destination in the migrate module.</dd>
  <dt>Clear</dt>
    <dd>An operation which deletes previously-migrated content, generally in
        preparation for remigration.</dd>
  <dt>Import</dt>
    <dd>An operation which imports content represented by a content set into
        Drupal objects. By default this operation only processes source data
        which has not yet been migrated, but optionally it can also update
        previously-imported destination objects with the current source data.</dd>
  <dt>Map tables</dt>
    <dd>A table associated with each content set, holding mappings from the unique
        ID of a source view row to the unique ID of the Drupal object created from
        that row. This is used to keep track of which rows have been processed, and
        can also be used to develop audit views directly comparing source data to
        resulting Drupal data.</dd>
  <dt>Primary key</dt>
    <dd>In relational databases, a table's <em>primary key</em> consists of one or more
        columns which are unique for each row and never null, explicitly designated
        to uniquely identify each row. The migrate module uses this term to
        describe a unique non-null column for a source view - in most cases, this
        will actually be the primary key of the base table of the view, but you
        may designate another unique column to function as a primary key for
        the purpose of migration. This column is used as the source ID in map
        tables.</dd>
