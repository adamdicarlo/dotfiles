<p>This page allows you to view and edit a content set, in particular to add mappings
   from source data to Drupal fields. The content set attributes are as follows (note
   that the source view and destination are inherent to the content set and cannot
   be changed after it is created):</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>A user-friendly name for the content set, used for display in various places. It
        also may be used to specify which content set to process on a drush command.</dd>
  <dt>Source view</dt>
    <dd>A <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">view</a> containing the source data
        for this content set. This view must contain a single row for each destination
        object to be created (e.g., a single row per user, or per Page node). It also
        must have at least one unique data column. Views with exposed filters will not
        work with migration - they will always return 0 rows.</dd>
  <dt>View arguments</dt>
    <dd>It may be that you want to use a single view as the source for multiple content
        sets - for example, you might have an incoming "content" table which contains
        both articles and blog entries. In this case, you would add an argument to the
        view definition to distinguish the cases, and create separate content sets
        for the different cases. Here you specify the distinct argument used to select
        rows from the view for this content set.</dd>
  <dt>Destination</dt>
    <dd>The Drupal object which this content set will populate. The migrate module has
        builtin support for the following Drupal objects, and you can also use hooks
        to define customer destinations:
        <ul>
          <li>Comment</li>
          <li>Node (a separate destination is provided for each different content type
              defined for your site)</li>
          <li>Taxonomy term</li>
          <li>User</li>
          <li>Role</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
  <dt>Primary key</dt>
    <dd>A unique non-null column from the source view, which the migrate module will
        use in maintaining a map between source rows and resulting Drupal objects.</dd>
  <dt>Weight</dt>
    <dd>A numerical value used to order content sets in listings, and when processing
        multiple content sets in a single operation. For example, if you are migrating
        roles, then assigned migrated roles to users, you should give your role content
        set a lower weight than the user content set so it is processed first.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Content mappings</h2>

<p>Here is the crux of the process - specifying what source fields map to what Drupal
fields. For each destination field, you may choose a column from the the source view,
an explicit default value, both, or neither. If you specify only a source field, that
value will be copied to the mapped Drupal field on import. If you specify only a
default value, that value will be copied. If both are specified, the value of the
source field will be used if present - if it is not (the value is NULL), the default
value will be used. If nothing is specified, the destination field will default according
to its own rules - generally it will be left empty, but some fields may receive default
values (for example, <em>Node: Authored on</em> will default to the current date and time).
