<p>The <a href="admin/content/migrate/dashboard">dashboard page</a> is used to monitor
   and control migration processes.</p>

<h3>Processes</h3>

<p>All content sets are listed here in order of weight. For each content set listed,
   you will see the following items:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Clear/Import</dt>
    <dd>These toggles enable processes to run - see the glossary for details.</dd>
  <dt>Content Set</dt>
    <dd>The name of the content set. This name can be used to specify a particular content
        set in a drush command. It is linked to the edit page for the content set.</dd>
  <dt>Total rows</dt>
    <dd>A count of the total rows in the source view.</dd>
  <dt>Imported</dt>
    <dd>A count of the Drupal objects successfully created for this content set. If
        any of these objects generated informational messages (conditions interesting
        enough to report, but not severe enough to prevent successful import) there
        will be a link to the messages here.</dd>
  <dt>Unimported</dt>
    <dd>A count of source rows which have not yet been migrated, or which failed to migrate
        successfully. If there were any failures, there will be links to the messages here.</dd>
  <dt>Last imported</dt>
    <dd>The date and time that the last import or scan completed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Any content set currently being processed is
  <span class="migrate-running">highlighted</span>.</p>

<h3>Execute</h3>

<p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a> is the preferred means of running
  migration processes. However,
  particularly while developing your migration processes, you may want to run processes
  directly in the browser. To do so, open the <strong>Execute</strong> fieldset and submit
  the form. You may set the following parameters for an interactive run:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Update previously-imported content</dt>
  <dd>Equivalent to the --update option in drush, this causes previously-imported content
      to be remigrated from the current source data, in addition to new content being imported.</dd>
  <dt>Sample size</dt>
  <dd>If set, this number of rows of each checked content set will be processed before completion.</dd>
  <dt>Source IDs</dt>
  <dd>If set to a comma-separated list of primary keys from the source view, those specific
    IDs will be run through each checked process. This is useful when determining a problem
    processing a specific row of source data.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When executing interactively, first any Clear actions are run in reverse order,
then any Import actions are run in forward order.</p>
<p><strong>Stop all running tasks</strong> can be used to cleanly exit any processes
running elsewhere (i.e., any processes that are <span class="migrate-running">highlighted</span>).</p>

<p>In the lower area of the page, you may create a new content set, providing these
   parameters:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>A user-friendly name for the content set, used for display in various places. It
        also may be used to specify which content set to process on a drush command.</dd>
  <dt>Destination</dt>
    <dd>The Drupal object which this content set will populate. The migrate module has
        builtin support for the following Drupal objects, and you can also use hooks
        to define customer destinations:
        <ul>
          <li>Comment</li>
          <li>Node (a separate destination is provided for each different content type
              defined on your site)</li>
          <li>Taxonomy term</li>
          <li>User</li>
          <li>Role</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
  <dt>Source view</dt>
    <dd>A <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">view</a> containing the source data
        for this content set. This view must contain a single row for each destination
        object to be created (e.g., a single row per user, or per Page node). It also
        must have at least one unique data column.</dd>
  <dt>View arguments</dt>
    <dd>It may be that you want to use a single view as the source for multiple content
        sets - for example, you might have an incoming "content" table which contains
        both articles and blog entries. In this case, you would add an argument to the
        view definition to distinguish the cases, and create separate content sets
        for the different cases. Here you specify the distinct argument used to select
        rows from the view for this content set.</dd>
  <dt>Weight</dt>
    <dd>A numerical value used to order content sets in listings, and when processing
        multiple content sets in a single operation. For example, if you are migrating
        roles, then assigned migrated roles to users, you should give your role content
        set a lower weight than the user content set so it is processed first.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When you click the <strong>Add</strong> button, the content set is created, with its
   primary key defaulted to the primary key of its base table (if there is one), and the
   content set's edit page is displayed to allow you to add mappings.</p>
