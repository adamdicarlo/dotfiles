DESCRIPTION
-----------

Drush Views (The Drupal Shell Views interface) allows you to
list, import, export and delete views from the command line.

It provides the following commands: "views list", "views import",
"views export" and "views delete".

Run "drush help <command>" to see supported command line options
and arguments.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
No special requirements on unix-like systems.
Drush Views uses the ordinary PHP commands for file and directory
handling, but it is still untested on Windows.
Drush Views 2.x will only work with Drush 2.x. Use Drush Views 1.x if
you are still using Drush 1.x.
