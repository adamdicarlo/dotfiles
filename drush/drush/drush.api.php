/**
 * @file
 * Documentation of the Drush API.
 *
 * All drush commands are invoked in a specific order, using
 * drush-made hooks, very similar to the Drupal hook system. See drush_invoke()
 * for the actual implementation.
 *
 * For any command named "hook", the following hooks are called, in
 * order:
 *
 * 1. drush_hook_COMMAND_validate()
 * 2. drush_hook_pre_COMMAND()
 * 3. drush_hook_COMMAND()
 * 4. drush_hook_post_COMMAND()
 *
 * For example, here are the hook opportunities for a mysite.drush.inc file
 * that wants to hook into the `pm-download` command.
 *
 * 1. drush_mysite_pm_download_validate()
 * 2. drush_mysite_pre_pm_download()
 * 3. drush_mysite_pm_download()
 * 4. drush_mysite_post_pm_download()
 *
 * If any of those fails, the rollback mechanism is called. It will
 * call, in reverse, all _rollback hooks. The mysite command file can implement
 * the following rollback hooks:
 *
 * 1. drush_mysite_post_pm_download_rollback()
 * 2. drush_mysite_pm_download_rollback()
 * 3. drush_mysite_pre_pm_download_rollback()
 * 4. drush_mysite_pm_download_validate_rollback()
 *
 * Before any command is called, hook_drush_init() is also called.
 * hook_drush_exit() is called at the very end of command invocation.
