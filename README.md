My configuration files; this repository serves mostly to back them up. Ideally I'll use these on both Linux and OS X, and not find myself scp'ing configurations around anymore.

Still trying to figure out how I should add my vim plugins; I guess I'll need a special case in the script to set those up (create symlinks) when "deploying" my configuration to a new machine.
